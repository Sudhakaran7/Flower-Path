You have N gardens, labelled 1 to N.  In each garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers.
paths[i] = [x, y] describes the existence of a bidirectional path from garden x to garden y.
Also, there is no garden that has more than 3 paths coming into or leaving it.
Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.
Return any such a choice as an array answer, where answer[i] is the type of flower planted in the (i+1)-th garden.  The flower types are denoted 1, 2, 3, or 4.  
It is guaranteed an answer exists.

Input Description:
First line contains, N and M as integers as input.(1<N,M<1000)
Rest line contains, Mx2 as integers in matrix.(matrix[i]<M)

Output Description:
Print the array is the type of flower planted in the garden.

Sample Input:
3 3
1 2
2 3
3 1

Sample Output:
1 2 3

Explanation:
The given plant types are 1,2,3 and the path are (1,2),(2,3),(3,1).so the plant path is 1,2,3.
